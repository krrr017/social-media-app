local development: create a .env
(make sure to name it .env) in the server folder, which exports your db.url connection.


# Install

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places.
First run npm install from the root.

### Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)
```bash
$ cd client          // go to client folder
$ npm i              // npm install packages
$ npm run start      // run it locally
```
### Server-side usage(PORT3001)
```bash
// root level
$ cd server
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

# Getting Started
#### Create a .env file in the server folder.
##### After you created .env file, you need to add your Mongo_URL,JWR_SECRET, and PORT.
